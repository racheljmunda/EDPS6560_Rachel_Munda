				The basis of my instructional design philosophy is making informed design decisions based on the multiple 
				steps of the design process. Each step is crucial in developing meaningful instruction for learners to develop 
				and master the skills defined by the goals of the learning. The primary set of steps in the design process is to 
				help the designer gain the background knowledge to make effective decisions in designing and developing the 
				learning objectives, materials, assessments, and evaluations. The secondary set of steps in the process is the 
				actual practice of creating the content and materials to be used in the instruction. 
				<br><br>
				The first step of the design process is to conduct a front-end analysis, which will help the designer identify the 
				problem to be addressed through instruction. This step is significant since some issues cannot be solved through 
				instruction, which the designer will determine. The learner analysis is the second step which is essential in providing 
				information to drive the instructional design and implementation and be utilized throughout the entire process. 
				Through this analysis, you determine learners’ entry skills, prior knowledge, attitudes, and motivations. This should 
				always be top of mind for a design to help them choose the content and instructional strategies to be effectively used 
				through the learning process. From these two steps, the goals and learning objectives are determined based on the problem 
				to be solved and the background information that was collected about the learners. After identifying the goals and 
				performance objectives, the designer will determine the context of this instruction. This needs to include the space, 
				materials, resources, media, learner participation, and assessments.
				<br><br>
				The designer’s role is not complete once the instruction is designed and developed. They need to be reflective of their 
				work and the learners’ performance. They can achieve this through an evaluation process of the instruction and get feedback 
				from learners to help make adjustments and improvements to the instructional modules. There are many forms of evaluation, 
				but the most crucial part is for the designer to take the feedback and implement it in improving the instruction to meet 
				the needs of the learners.
